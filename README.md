# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Web Application using Flask and creating Docker Image

This project implements a web application for recognizing handwritten digits using a pre-trained model. The application is built using the Flask framework, which allows for creating web interfaces with Python.

The main functionality of the application is to accept user-drawn images of digits, process them, and predict the corresponding digit using a trained model

## Dependencies

To run the application, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Flask (install using `pip install flask`)
- Keras (install using `pip install keras`)
- NumPy (install using `pip install numpy`)
- TensorFlow (install using `pip install tensorflow`)
- PIL (install using `pip install pillow`)

## Usage
Draw a digit on the provided canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse.

Click the "Recognize" button to submit the drawn digit for prediction.

The application will display the predicted digit on the screen.
